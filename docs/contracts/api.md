# Otto API Contract — /api/v1 (FROZEN)

All DTO names refer to types in `crates/otto-core/src/api.rs` (Rust) mirrored in
`ui/src/lib/api/types.ts` (TS). JSON: snake_case fields, RFC3339 timestamps, ULID ids.
Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` unless marked public. Errors: HTTP status per
`otto_core::Error` variant + body `Problem{code,message}`.

Roles: `root` = global; workspace roles `viewer < editor < admin`. Root passes every check.
"member" below means any authenticated user; workspace-scoped routes require at least the
listed role IN THAT WORKSPACE. Sessions/connections/repos/PRs inherit their workspace.

| 11 | GET /api/v1/workspaces | member | — | `WorkspaceWithRole[]` (root sees all as admin) |

Usage & metrics (embedded ClickHouse, all root-only; types in `crates/otto-usage`):
- GET /usage/status → UsageStatus (engine + ClickHouse health).
- GET /usage/summary?days=N&otto_only=B → UsageSummary. `days` 1–3650 (default 30),
  `otto_only` (default true) excludes externally-recorded sessions. Carries provider,
  daily, session, and **`by_kind`** (per-feature) rollups.
- GET /usage/by-kind?days=N&otto_only=B → `FeatureUsage[]` — the same per-feature rollup
  on its own. `FeatureUsage{feature, events, input_tokens, output_tokens,
  cache_read_tokens, cache_write_tokens, total_tokens, cost_usd, sessions}`. `feature` is
  the kind of Otto work — `review`|`product`|`channel`|`agent`|`connection`|`external`|…
  — derived server-side from each session's metadata (same label as a session row's
  `kind`). Visibility only; no budgets/enforcement. Pricing is unchanged (per-row
  `cost_usd` summed).
- GET /usage/metrics?minutes=N → `MetricPoint[]` (system CPU/RAM/load time-series).
- PUT /usage/config → UsageStatus (update + persist engine config).
- POST /usage/install → UsageStatus (install/update ClickHouse via the official installer).
- POST /ingest/usage → 204 — per-session token-usage ingest, gated by the per-session
  ingest token (`X-Otto-Session` + `X-Otto-Token`), not a bearer token.

Notes:
- `Connection` carries `environment` (`dev`|`staging`|`prod`, default `dev`) and `read_only`
  (bool, default `false`). `UpsertConnectionReq` accepts both: on **create** absent → defaults
  (`dev`/`false`); on **PATCH** absent → preserve the stored value. A connection is
  *write-guarded* when `environment=prod` OR `read_only=true`.
- DB Explorer query (`POST /api/v1/connections/{id}/db/query`, body `QueryRequest`) enforces the
  guardrail: on a write-guarded connection a statement classified as a write/DDL is rejected with
  `409 conflict` and a `Problem.message` prefixed `write_blocked: ` unless the request sets
  `confirm_write:true`. Read-vs-write is classified conservatively per engine (unknown → write).
  `explain:true` does NOT exempt a statement (the SQL drivers execute by statement text and ignore
  the flag), so a genuine read still passes on its own classification while a raw write tagged
  `explain:true` is still blocked. The UI requires a typed confirmation before sending
  `confirm_write`.
- Session create with kind=connection requires `connection_id`; provider is set server-side
  to the connection kind. Title defaults: agent → "<provider> #N", connection → conn name.
- PR routes resolve the provider + account from the repo row (`provider`, `git_account_id`);
  if the repo has no provider/account → 400 `invalid`.
- `/orchestrate` never executes; it only returns a plan. Execution is the separate call #24.
- Settings keys used in v1: `network_listener` `{enabled:bool, port:u16}`, `providers`
  (provider registry overrides), `default_provider` (string).

## Agent Swarm (#59–#86)

Teams ("swarms", never "companies") of role-specialized agents that work projects
broken into tasks, coordinated by a per-swarm runtime. Reads = `ws viewer`, mutations
+ lifecycle = `ws editor`. JSON snake_case, ULID ids, RFC3339 timestamps,
`Problem{code,message}` errors. Async runtime actions return a record to poll; live
updates also arrive over `/ws/events` (`swarm_*` events). Item routes resolve the
workspace from the row.

| — | POST /api/v1/ingest/swarm/board | session token | `{kind?,to_agent_id?,body}` | 204 |

Notes:
- `config.max_parallel_sessions` is the per-swarm concurrency cap (the Coordinator's
  parallel-worker limit). A blank create uses sensible defaults; create-from-preset
  (`preset_slug`) instantiates the org and maps each agent's provider to an installed
  CLI, falling back to the workspace default.
- Lifecycle: `start`/`resume` (re)start the Coordinator and set status `active`;
  `pause` stops new turns + suspends idle swarm sessions (status `paused`); `abort`
  cancels queued/running runs, kills swarm sessions (status `aborted`).
- `POST /ingest/swarm/board` is unauthenticated but **gated by the per-session ingest
  token** (`X-Otto-Session` + `X-Otto-Token`), like `/ingest/claude`; the agent posts
  via the materialized `otto-post` helper. The session's `meta` carries
  `swarm_id`/`agent_id`.
- Assigning a task to a *leader* (an agent with reports) triggers a delegation turn
  that decomposes it into subtasks for the reports.
- `SwarmRun.tokens_input` / `tokens_output` / `cost_usd` are backfilled on the run's
  terminal patch (done/error/stopped) from the embedded usage store (otto-usage),
  keyed on the run's `session_id`. They stay `null` when usage tracking is disabled or
  no usage was recorded for the session yet (e.g. transcript not yet flushed) — never a
  misleading `0`. The Run Inspector surfaces the parsed `result` (summary, `artifacts[]`),
  the run's `cwd`, the board posts tagged with this `run_id`, tokens/cost, and the raw
  result JSON; it is a pure client view (no new endpoint).

## API Tokens (#87–#89)

Long-lived personal access tokens for driving the daemon over HTTP from scripts/CLIs
(skills, CI, automation). They are issued per-user and flow through the same bearer-auth
path as login tokens — use as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on any route, or as
`?token=<token>` on the WebSocket endpoints. The raw secret is shown exactly once at
creation (only its SHA-256 hash is stored); `kind='api'` tokens have a ~10-year fixed
lifetime whose expiry is never slid (unlike the 30-day sliding login token). A token is
scoped to its owner's roles: a token created by a root user has root; otherwise it has
that user's workspace roles. Bootstrap one with a one-time login, then save it in the
`OTTO_API_TOKEN` env var.

| # | Method & path | Auth | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 87 | POST /api/v1/auth/tokens | member | CreateApiTokenReq `{label?}` | CreateApiTokenResp `{token, info}` (secret shown once) |
| 88 | GET /api/v1/auth/tokens | member | — | `ApiTokenInfo[]` (never the secret; newest first) |
| 89 | DELETE /api/v1/auth/tokens/{id} | member | — | 204 (404 if not found / not owned) |

Notes:
- `ApiTokenInfo` = `{id, label?, token_prefix, created_at, last_seen_at, expires_at}`.
  `token_prefix` is the first 12 chars of the raw token (for identifying it in a list);
  the rest is unrecoverable.
- `DELETE` only revokes the caller's own API tokens (scoped by `user_id` + `kind='api'`).
- `last_seen_at` is updated on use, throttled to at most once per hour.

# Otto API Contract — extended surface (v1, mounted)

The tables above (#1–#89) are the original frozen core. The sections below complete the
contract by documenting every other route the daemon actually registers (mounted via the
module routers in `crates/otto-server/src/modules.rs::module_routers`). They follow the same
conventions: all live under `/api/v1` with bearer auth (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or
`?token=` on WS), JSON snake_case, ULID ids, RFC3339 timestamps, `Problem{code,message}`
errors. Role column meaning is identical (`member`, `ws viewer/editor/admin`, `root`).
Item routes (those keyed by a row id, e.g. `/sessions/{id}`) resolve the owning workspace
from the row and role-check against it. This surface is a completion of the frozen contract,
not a redesign — no path here may change shape without a contract bump.

Mounting summary (all paths below are under `/api/v1` unless the section says "root-level"):
the `/api/v1` nest carries the bearer-auth middleware; root-level WS/proxy routers
self-authenticate via `?token=` and are merged at the server root by `build_router`.

## Activity trail & task tracker (live agent telemetry)

A session's append-only activity trail plus its current task list. The provider's hooks
write these via the per-session ingest token (see Ingest below); humans read them with a
bearer token. `TrailAppended` / `TasksUpdated` events mirror writes over `/ws/events`.

| Method & path | Auth | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET /workspaces/{wid}/sessions/{sid}/trail | ws viewer | — | `TrailEvent[]` (session activity trail) |
| POST /workspaces/{wid}/sessions/{sid}/trail | ws editor | TrailEvent | 204 (append one trail entry) |
| GET /workspaces/{wid}/sessions/{sid}/tasks | ws viewer | — | `AgentTask[]` (current task list) |
| PUT /workspaces/{wid}/sessions/{sid}/tasks | ws editor | `AgentTask[]` | 204 (replace the task list) |
| GET /workspaces/{wid}/activity/summary | ws viewer | — | per-session activity summary for the workspace |

## Sessions (extras beyond #17–#22)

| Method & path | Auth | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST /sessions/{id}/archive | ws editor | — | 204 (archive a channel/agent session) |
| POST /sessions/{id}/unarchive | ws editor | — | 204 (restore an archived session) |
| POST /sessions/{id}/input | ws editor | `SendInputReq{text, submit?}` — writes a keystroke/paste into the PTY (`submit` omitted/true appends a newline) | 204 |
| POST /sessions/{id}/handover | ws editor | — | starts a handover; progress via `SessionMetaUpdated` |
| POST /sessions/{id}/handover/brief | ws editor | — | generates a handover brief for the session |
| POST /sessions/{session_id}/attach-product | ws editor | `{story_id}` | attaches a product story to the session |
| POST /app/kill-sessions | member | — | terminate every live PTY (desktop quit hook) |

| POST /connection-sections/{id}/move | ws editor | MoveSectionReq | 204 |

## DB Explorer — engine access (`/connections/{id}/db/*`)

| POST /connections/{id}/db/object | ws viewer | `{ref}` | object detail (columns/DDL/etc.) |
| POST /connections/{id}/db/schema-graph | ws viewer | `{schema, max_tables?}` | DbSchemaGraph — read-only ERD: tables (+PK/FK-flagged columns) and FK edges, walked from the schema tree; `max_tables` default 60, clamped 1..200; engines without FK metadata (Redis/Mongo) return `relationships:false` |
| POST /connections/{id}/db/query | ws editor | RunQueryReq | query result rows / affected count |
| POST /connections/{id}/db/completion | ws viewer | `{text,cursor}` | SQL completion suggestions |
| GET /connections/{id}/db/history | ws viewer | — | recent query history |

| Method & path | Auth | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST /repos/{id}/prs/{number}/review | ws editor | StartReviewReq | Review (starts the agent fan-out) |

collections live under `/workspaces/{ws}/product/*`; item routes resolve the workspace from
the row. AI-producing actions (analyze/rewrite/generate/plan) live under
`/workspaces/{id}/product/...` and return 202 Accepted, streaming progress over `/ws/events`.

| POST /workspaces/{wid}/api-client/automations/{id}/run | ws editor | — | run an automation |
| POST /api-client/import-curl | member | `{curl}` | parsed Request from a curl command |

## Notifications (notification center)

| Method & path | Auth | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET /notifications | member | — | `Notice[]` — global/system notices + the caller's own (root sees all) |
| DELETE /notifications | member | — | clears the caller's own notices (root clears all; global/system notices remain for non-root) |
| GET /notifications/settings | member | — | notification settings |
| PUT /notifications/settings | member | NotificationSettings | settings |
| POST /notifications/read-all | member | — | marks the caller's own notices read (root marks all) |
| POST /notifications/{id}/read | member | — | mark one read (own only for non-root; global notices are read-only to them) |
| DELETE /notifications/{id} | member | — | dismiss one (own only for non-root) |

Scoping: a notice is either **global/system** (`user_id = null`, e.g. credential/session/skill-eval producers) or **owned by one user**. Non-root members see global + their own and may mutate only their own; the unread badge counts a member's own unread only (global notices show in the list but aren't counted, since a member can't mark them read). Root sees and mutates everything.

## Usage tracking & system metrics (embedded ClickHouse)

## Swarm lifecycle (explicit paths for #84)

Frozen #84 lists the four lifecycle actions as a single combined row; the daemon registers
them as four distinct routes. Each takes no body and returns the updated `Swarm`.

| Method & path | Auth | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST /workspaces/{id}/swarm/swarms/{sid}/start | ws editor | — | Swarm (start/restart the Coordinator) |
| POST /workspaces/{id}/swarm/swarms/{sid}/pause | ws editor | — | Swarm (pause new turns; suspend idle sessions) |
| POST /workspaces/{id}/swarm/swarms/{sid}/abort | ws editor | — | Swarm (cancel runs; kill swarm sessions) |
| POST /workspaces/{id}/swarm/swarms/{sid}/resume | ws editor | — | Swarm (resume from paused) |

## Root-level routers (NOT under /api/v1; `?token=` auth)

These self-authenticate via the `?token=` query parameter and are merged at the server root
(not under the `/api/v1` nest). The two terminal/event WebSockets are specified in detail in
`ws.md`.

| Method & path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET /ws/term/{session_id} | `?token=`; ws viewer attach, editor input | terminal stream (see ws.md) |
| GET /ws/events | `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: otto-bearer, <token>` (preferred — keeps the token out of the URL) or `?token=` fallback; member | daemon event stream (see ws.md) |
| GET /ws/lsp?lang=&root=&token= | `?token=`; ws editor | LSP WebSocket bridge |
| GET /ws/api-client/stream?token= | `?token=`; ws editor | API-client streaming-response bridge |
| GET /browser/proxy?url=&token= | `?token=` | in-app browser HTTP proxy |

## Ingest (per-session token, unauthenticated by bearer)

These are reachable without a user bearer token; each is gated by the per-session ingest
token Otto sets on the agent PTY (`X-Otto-Session` + `X-Otto-Token`), verified inside the
handler. Agent hooks (which have no user session) post to them.

| Method & path | Gate | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST /ingest/claude | session token | Claude hook event | 204 |
| POST /ingest/codex | session token | Codex hook event | 204 |
| POST /ingest/usage | session token | token-usage event | 204 |
| POST /ingest/swarm/board | session token | `{kind?,to_agent_id?,body}` | 204 (also listed at #—, swarm) |

Notes:
- The `/api/v1` public exemptions (no bearer required) are exactly: `/health`, `/meta`,
  `/onboarding/root`, `/auth/login`, and the four `/ingest/*` routes (session-token gated).
- `kill_all_sessions` (`POST /app/kill-sessions`) is mounted in the sessions api_router, so
  its full path is `/api/v1/app/kill-sessions` and it requires a bearer token.
- Several AI-producing routes (analyze/rewrite/generate/plan/review) return `202 Accepted`
  and stream progress over `/ws/events`; poll the corresponding GET for the latest state.
